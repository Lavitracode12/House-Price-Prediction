# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning:

This is my first machine learning project, where I built a model to predict house prices using the Random Forest Regressor. The dataset contains various features like the number of rooms, area, location details, and more.

# Project Highlights

*Built using Python and Scikit-learn

*Achieved R² score of 0.804

*Basic data preprocessing and feature selection

*Trained and evaluated with a Random Forest model

# Dataset
Used the "California housing prices" dataset from Kaggle.

# Technologies Used

*Python

*Pandas

*NumPy

*Scikit-learn

*Matplotlib  

*Seaborn

# Workflow

*Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and dropped irrelevant features.

*Feature Engineering: Selected numerical and categorical features.

*Model Training: Used RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble.

*Evaluation: Evaluated the model using R² Score.

# Result

R² Score: 0.804
